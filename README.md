# personal-portfolio-site

CRUD app using NodeJS, Express &amp; MongoDB  as backend &amp; server side rendering with PUG for the templates.
I use this application to showcase my work and as a way of learning new skills. 
It is available in french and english - thanks to [i18n-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-mongo)

=========

* Backend : Express - NodeJs - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
* Templating: Pug (service side rendering)

If you want to see how it looks, you can see the code in action [here](http://williambloch.com)

I didn't make the code 'ready to install' on this project, so it might take some work to get it to work on your computer, but if you realy want to: 
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Svanaks/personal-portfolio-site.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Change some config options (config folder and app.js mainly) 
4. Create a DB.
5. To start the app: `npm start`
